# Summarize Co.
Never approach a company without knowing them ever again. Never spend minutes searching the web just to get the quick summary you need. Summarize Co. searches the web for you so you can focus on getting that job. Created for HackGT 2016.

## About
Built using Flask and Python, the website draws information from various database APIs to generate search results. Currently, the website parses information obtained from the Wikipedia API, Indeed API, and the Google News RSS feed to produce a snapshot of the company's work, hirings, and recent news. This project was produced in collaboration with three other team members at HackGT 2016 over the course of 36 hours. Check out the current website at summarizeco.herokuapp.com

## Usage
To run the server, do:
`python senddata.py`
